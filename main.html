			<h2>Dress sense for men: What went wrong?</h2>

<p>So how was it decided in Europe, Australia and the USA that dresses were the exclusive fashion domain of females?
I think about how I have spent all my life covering the bottom half of my body with the choice of only 2 items: trousers and short trousers. Thinking from this perspective, it seems unbelievably restrictive that half the population in Australia is trapped with the same restriction. Why is it the case and what possible advantage does it offer the 50% of subscribers to this way of life or to the fairer half who seem to have avoided this dress restriction?</p>
<p>Now that I am entering or possibly well into the second half of my life in this universe, I have started asking myself the question of whether I have missed something important by sticking with this undiscussed and unchanging condition which seems to be socially imposed on all males in Australia since it was invaded by Europeans in the 1700’s.  Certainly prior to that, dress codes for men in Australia seemed to be more sensible for the climate we experience here. You could wear full clothing when it was cold and any type of optional attire when it was hot. In fact the dress code was about more practical taking into account such things as the temperature and how comfortable you wanted to be. </p>
<p>If we look at traditional clothing in our neighbouring countries, we see often that clothing for men was either optional or at least less restrictive. Trousers and shorts were certainly not the norm. For the most developed countries, flowing robes and dresses have been more acceptable than trousers. Take for instance the Indian Antriya . This garment was worn by either men or women with differences in the colour or accessories. The later Dhoti worn similarly and is still the national men’s garment in the countries of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In Thailand, it only became inappropriate to wear the traditional Chong Kraben (cloth wrapped around the lower body and legs) in 1941 in response to negative reactions from western culture.
Throughout history, the Japanese have been arguably the best dressed culture in the Asian region. In Japan, it is still acceptable for men to wear the Andon hakama (skirt version) in both formal and informal occasions.</p>
<A HREF="image/IMG_0395.JPG"><IMG SRC="images/IMG_0395.JPG" ALT="wedding" BORDER=0></A>
<p>
It seems odd that two of the most memorable and comfortable occasions in my life were both wearing dresses; the first time was running as a competitor in an annual charity event, the Red Dress run, sponsored by the Hash House Harriers, a self-proclaimed "drinking club with a running problem,". In that race, there are only two rules: You gotta wear red and it has to be a dress. Yes I was drunk so could not determine if I was feeling liberated due to the alcohol or the dress I (and the other 300 men and women entered) was wearing.
 I was married wearing a hakuma and kimono in Japan. It was very comfortable and certainly seemed more stylish than what I could have imagined prior to leaving Australia on a youthful adventure in my twenties. While I now reside back in Australia, I remember fondly the occasions in Japan wearing a yukata and hakuma. If only there was not some sort of stigma in Australia about guys not wearing pants.</p>
<p>
If we can look to the future through visionaries such as George Lucas, it is interesting that he should choose to dress the coolest characters, the Jedi Knights in robes and skirts although pants have been added to avoid any bare skin on the limbs as one of their rules to allow viewers of all cultures to avoid offence.
China has also had their Changshan men’s dress since the Qing dynasty but again, it seems like only Western Christian mockery of dresses has caused most of Asian aristocratic men to adopt the western-style limited choice of trousers for formal international gatherings.</p>
<p>
In Australia, I am looking forward to a time when we are all not so bound by the social limitations of our immediate past and we can embrace lessons of our traditional residents for a variety of lifestyle options.

The weather here in Hobart has been pretty cold and rainy. Difficult to get motivated to be outdoors. So have been concentrating on work that can be done indoors.
</p>
<p>In the images on the right, there is the workbench project and the potplant holder project. Next is the shelves inside the studio and then more benches in the workshop.</p>

		This Web site contains some information about my family and our life in Tasmania, Sweden, Japan and Spain, the four places where we have spent the most time in the past fifteen years.<BR>
		There is a page or two devoted (not entirely) to <a href="secondpage.html">Tasmania</a>
		and another with yacht sailing <a href="images.html">computer simulation </a>content.

        <p>
        Right now I have developed and built a new moth sail design which is being built at <a href="http://www.northsails.co.jp" target="blank">North Sails Japan</a>.
        You can read about it <a href="moth/index.html" target="blank">here</a>.
